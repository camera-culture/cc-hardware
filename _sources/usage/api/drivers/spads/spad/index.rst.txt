.. py:class:: SPADSensor


   Bases: :py:obj:`cc_hardware.drivers.sensor.Sensor`

   An abstract base class for Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) sensors, designed
   to manage histogram-based measurements. This class defines methods and properties
   related to collecting and analyzing histogram data.

   Inherits:
       Sensor: The base class for all sensors in the system.

   .. py:property:: num_bins
      :type: int
      :abstractmethod:

      Returns the number of bins in the sensor's histogram. This indicates the
      number of discrete values or ranges that the sensor can measure. The total
      distance a sensor can measure is equal to the number of bins multiplied by
      the bin width.

      :returns: *int* -- The total number of bins in the histogram.

   .. py:property:: resolution
      :type: tuple[int, int]
      :abstractmethod:

      Returns the resolution of the sensor as a tuple (width, height). This indicates
      the spatial resolution of the sensor, where the width and height refer to the
      number of pixels or sampling points in the respective dimensions.

      :returns: *tuple[int, int]* --

                A tuple representing the sensor's resolution
                    (width, height).

   .. py:method:: accumulate(num_samples)
      :abstractmethod:

      Accumulates the specified number of histogram samples from the sensor.

      :Parameters: **num_samples** (*int*) -- The number of samples to accumulate into the histogram.
                   The accumulation method (i.e. summing, averaging) may vary depending on
                   the sensor.
