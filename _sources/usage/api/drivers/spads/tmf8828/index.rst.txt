.. py:module:: drivers.spads.tmf8828

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   TMF8828 sensor driver for SPAD sensors.

   The `TMF8828     <https://ams-osram.com/products/sensor-solutions/        direct-time-of-flight-sensors-dtof/            ams-tmf8828-configurable-8x8-multi-zone-time-of-flight-sensor>`_
   is a 8x8 multi-zone time-of-flight sensor made by AMS. It uses a wide VCSEL and supports
   custom mapping of SPAD pixels to allow for 3x3, 4x4, 3x6, and 8x8 multizone output. The
   :class:`~drivers.spads.tmf8828.TMF8828Sensor` class was developed to interface with the
   `TMF882X Arduino Shield     <https://ams-osram.com/products/boards-kits-accessories/kits/        ams-tmf882x-evm-eb-shield-evaluation-kit>`_.

.. py:class:: SPADID(*args, **kwds)


   Bases: :py:obj:`enum.Enum`

   Create a collection of name/value pairs.

   Example enumeration:

   >>> class Color(Enum):
   ...     RED = 1
   ...     BLUE = 2
   ...     GREEN = 3

   Access them by:

   - attribute access:

     >>> Color.RED
     <Color.RED: 1>

   - value lookup:

     >>> Color(1)
     <Color.RED: 1>

   - name lookup:

     >>> Color['RED']
     <Color.RED: 1>

   Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

   >>> len(Color)
   3

   >>> list(Color)
   [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

   Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
   attributes -- see the documentation for details.

   .. py:method:: get_num_pixels()

      Returns the number of pixels based on the SPAD ID.

      :returns: *int* -- The number of pixels corresponding to the SPAD ID.


   .. py:method:: get_num_channels()

      Returns the number of channels based on the SPAD ID.

      :returns: *int* -- The number of channels corresponding to the SPAD ID.


   .. py:method:: get_active_channels_per_subcapture()

      Returns the number of active channels per subcapture based on the SPAD ID.

      :returns: *list[int]* --

                A list representing the number of active channels in each
                    subcapture.


   .. py:method:: get_resolution()

      Returns the resolution of the sensor based on the SPAD ID.

      :returns: *tuple[int, int]* -- The resolution (width, height) corresponding to the SPAD ID.



.. py:class:: RangeMode(*args, **kwds)


   Bases: :py:obj:`enum.Enum`

   Create a collection of name/value pairs.

   Example enumeration:

   >>> class Color(Enum):
   ...     RED = 1
   ...     BLUE = 2
   ...     GREEN = 3

   Access them by:

   - attribute access:

     >>> Color.RED
     <Color.RED: 1>

   - value lookup:

     >>> Color(1)
     <Color.RED: 1>

   - name lookup:

     >>> Color['RED']
     <Color.RED: 1>

   Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

   >>> len(Color)
   3

   >>> list(Color)
   [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

   Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
   attributes -- see the documentation for details.


.. py:class:: TMF8828Histogram(spad_id)


   Bases: :py:obj:`cc_hardware.drivers.sensor.SensorData`

   A class representing histogram data collected from the TMF8828 sensor. The histogram
   data is organized into multiple channels and subcaptures to capture detailed
   measurements.

   :Parameters: **spad_id** (*SPADID*) -- The SPAD ID indicating the resolution of the sensor.

   .. py:property:: has_data
      :type: bool

      Checks if the histogram has complete data for all subcaptures.

      :returns: *bool* -- True if all subcaptures have been processed, False otherwise.

   .. py:method:: reset()

      Resets the histogram data, clearing temporary and accumulated data arrays.


   .. py:method:: process(row)

      Processes a single row of histogram data. Updates the internal data arrays based
      on the channel and subcapture configuration.

      :Parameters: **row** (*list[str]*) -- A list of strings representing a row of data received from
                   the sensor.


   .. py:method:: get_data()

      Returns a copy of the accumulated histogram data and resets the internal state.

      :returns: *np.ndarray* -- The accumulated histogram data.

   A class representing the TMF8828 sensor, a specific implementation of a SPAD sensor.
   The TMF8828 sensor collects histogram data across multiple channels and subcaptures,
   enabling high-resolution depth measurements.

      :type: bool

      Checks if the sensor is operational.

      :returns: *bool* -- True if the sensor is operational, False otherwise.

   .. py:property:: num_bins
      :type: int

      Returns the number of bins in the sensor's histogram.

      :returns: *int* -- The number of bins in the histogram.

   .. py:property:: resolution
      :type: tuple[int, int]

      Returns the resolution of the sensor as a tuple (width, height).

      :returns: *tuple[int, int]* -- The resolution (width, height) based on the SPAD ID.

   .. py:method:: accumulate(num_samples, *, average = True)

      Accumulates histogram samples from the sensor.

      :Parameters: * **num_samples** (*int*) -- The number of samples to accumulate.
                   * **average** (*bool*) -- Whether to average the accumulated samples. Defaults to
                     True.

      :returns: *np.ndarray | list[np.ndarray]* --

                The accumulated histogram data, averaged if
                    requested.


   .. py:method:: calibrate(configurations = 2)

      Performs calibration on the sensor. This will run calibration for each
      configuration.
