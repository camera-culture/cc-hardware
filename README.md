## Other Details

### Repo Structure

`cc_hardware` is a monorepo that contains multiple packages. Each package is a
subdirectory within the `pkgs` directory and should be installed as a separate package
(done automatically with `poetry install`/`pip install .` as described in
[Getting Started](#getting-started)).

The current supported packages are as follows:

- [`algos`](https://camera-culture.github.io/cc-hardware/usage/api/cc_hardware/algos):
    Contains algorithms for processing data.
- [`drivers`](https://camera-culture.github.io/cc-hardware/usage/api/cc_hardware/drivers):
    Contains drivers for interfacing with hardware.
- [`utils`](https://camera-culture.github.io/cc-hardware/usage/api/cc_hardware/utils):
    Contains utility functions and classes.
- [`tools`](https://camera-culture.github.io/cc-hardware/usage/api/cc_hardware/tools):
    Contains tools for working with hardware, such as calibration or visualization
    scripts.

### Package Structure

Each package is structured as follows:

```
pkgs/
    <package_name>/
        README.md
        poetry.toml
        pyproject.toml
        cc_hardware/
            <package_name>/
                __init__.py
                ...
```

In this way, when installing each package, the import path will be
`cc_hardware.<package_name>.<module_name>`.
